You want to run a binary search on a projects commit history to find out which commit introduced a bug.

```
git bisect start # Starts the binary search
git bisect bad  # Marks the current commit as having the bug
git bisect good <commit sha or tag> # tell git which commit or tag did not have the bug
```

Git will count the number of commits between the ones you've marked *good* and *bad*, and checkout out the middle commit. You can run your test on the middle commit and check if the bug is present. 
If it is present, run
```
git bisect bad
```
else
```
git bsiect good
```
Continue this until you isolate the commit that introduced the bug. 

At the end run 
```
git bisect reset 
```
to end the binary search.
